# ServiceNow DevOps Register Package GitHub Action

This custom action needs to be added at step level in a job to register package details in ServiceNow instance.

# Usage
## Step 1: Prepare values for setting up your secrets for Actions
- credentials (Devops integration token of a GitHub tool created in ServiceNow DevOps or username and password for a ServiceNow devops integration user)
- instance URL for your ServiceNow dev, test, prod, etc. environments
- tool_id of your GitHub tool created in ServiceNow DevOps

## Step 2: Configure Secrets in your GitHub Ogranization or GitHub repository
On GitHub, go in your organization settings or repository settings, click on the _Secrets > Actions_ and create a new secret.

Create secrets called 
- `SN_DEVOPS_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` required for token based authentication
- `SN_DEVOPS_USER` required for basic authentication at ServiceNow instance
- `SN_DEVOPS_PASSWORD` required for basic authentication at ServiceNow instance
- `SN_INSTANCE_URL` your ServiceNow instance URL, for example **https://test.service-now.com**
- `SN_ORCHESTRATION_TOOL_ID` only the **sys_id** is required for the GitHub tool created in your ServiceNow instance

## Step 3: Configure the GitHub Action if need to adapt for your needs or workflows
## For Token based Authentication at ServiceNow instance
```yaml
registerpackage:
    name: Register Package
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: ServiceNow Register Package
        uses: ServiceNow/servicenow-devops-register-package@v1.39.0
        with:
          devops-integration-token: ${{ secrets.SN_DEVOPS_INTEGRATION_TOKEN }}
          instance-url: ${{ secrets.SN_INSTANCE_URL }}
          tool-id: ${{ secrets.SN_ORCHESTRATION_TOOL_ID }}
          context-github: ${{ toJSON(github) }}
          job-name: 'Register Package'
          artifacts: '[{"name": "com:customactiondemo","version": "1.${{ github.run_number }}","semanticVersion": "1.${{ github.run_number }}.0","repositoryName": "${{ github.repository }}"}]'
          package-name: 'registerpackage.war'
```
## For Basic Authentication at ServiceNow instance
```yaml
registerpackage:
    name: Register Package
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: ServiceNow Register Package
        uses: ServiceNow/servicenow-devops-register-package@v1.34.2
        with:
          devops-integration-user-name: ${{ secrets.SN_DEVOPS_USER }}
          devops-integration-user-passwd: ${{ secrets.SN_DEVOPS_PASSWORD }}
          instance-url: ${{ secrets.SN_INSTANCE_URL }}
          tool-id: ${{ secrets.SN_ORCHESTRATION_TOOL_ID }}
          context-github: ${{ toJSON(github) }}
          job-name: 'Register Package'
          artifacts: '[{"name": "com:customactiondemo","version": "1.${{ github.run_number }}","semanticVersion": "1.${{ github.run_number }}.0","repositoryName": "${{ github.repository }}"}]'
          package-name: 'registerpackage.war'
```
The values for secrets should be setup in Step 1. Secrets should be created in Step 2.

## Support Model

ServiceNow customers may request support through the [Now Support (HI) portal](https://support.servicenow.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fnow_support_home.do).

## Governance Model

Initially, ServiceNow product management and engineering representatives will own governance of these integrations to ensure consistency with roadmap direction. In the longer term, we hope that contributors from customers and our community developers will help to guide prioritization and maintenance of these integrations. At that point, this governance model can be updated to reflect a broader pool of contributors and maintainers.
